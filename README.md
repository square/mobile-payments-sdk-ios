# Square Mobile Payments SDK

Build remarkable in-person experiences using Square's Mobile Payments SDK product, now in beta. Use the Mobile Payments SDK to accept in-person payments using Square hardware. The Mobile Payments SDK has the advantage of being an API-driven framework that allows for full customization and uses the latest [v2/payments](https://developer.squareup.com/explorer/square/payments-api/list-payments) API.

Learn what you can do with the Mobile Payments SDK [here](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/mobile-payments-sdk).

## Installation

### 1. Add frameworks using SPM or CocoaPods

#### Option A. Swift Package Manager

Install with [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager/) by following these steps:

1. Select `File > Add Package Dependencies...`.
2. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/square/mobile-payments-sdk-ios`.
3. Select the `Exact Version` dependency rule and specify the version as `2.0.0-beta1`.
4. Ensure the `SquareMobilePaymentsSDK` product is added to your target.

Optionally, you can also add the `MockReaderUI` product to your target to simulate a physical reader when one is not present in a sandbox environment.

#### Option B. CocoaPods

Install with [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) by adding the following to your `Podfile`:

```
use_frameworks!

pod "SquareMobilePaymentsSDK", "~> 2.0.0-beta1"

# Optionally include MockReaderUI if you wish to simulate a physical reader when one is not present.
# This feature is only available when provided a sandbox application ID.
pod "MockReaderUI", "~> 2.0.0-beta1", configurations: ['Debug']
```
_Note that MockReaderUI framework **requires** the `SquareMobilePaymentsSDK` framework to also be present in your `Podfile`._

### 2. Add build phase to setup the framework

On your application targetsâ€™ `Build Phases` settings tab, click the + icon and choose `New Run Script Phase`. Create a Run Script in which you specify your shell (ex: /bin/sh), and add the following contents to the script area below the shell:
```
SETUP_SCRIPT=${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}"/SquareMobilePaymentsSDK.framework/setup"
if [ -f "$SETUP_SCRIPT" ]; then
  "$SETUP_SCRIPT"
fi
```

Make sure this build phase is after any `[CP] Embed Pods Frameworks` or `Embed Frameworks` Build Phase.

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that the `MockReaderUI` product should only be used in debug configurations and is not to be included in the release version of your application.

### 3. Start integrating the SDK

Follow the [Build on iOS guide](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/mobile-payments-sdk/ios#3-initialize-the-mobile-payments-sdk) to learn how to integrate the Mobile Payments SDK in your app.

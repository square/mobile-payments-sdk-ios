# Square Mobile Payments SDK Example Apps


### Assumptions and prerequisites

These example apps make the following assumptions:

* You have read the [Mobile Payments SDK "Build on iOS"](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/mobile-payments-sdk/ios) documentation. These example apps focus on demonstrating how the Square Mobile Payments SDK works by using all of the provided user interfaces of the SDK.
* You have a Square account enabled for payment processing. If you have not
  enabled payment processing on your account (or you are not sure), visit
  [squareup.com/activate](https://squareup.com/activate).
